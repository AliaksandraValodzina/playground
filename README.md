#Playground

This is just a playground for my personal codes and bits.  Mostly it'll be Xamarin proof of concept projects.

##Description of projects

* __UIScrollViewHorizontal__ - Xamarin.iOS native example of how to use a UICollectionView in a horizontal list to show a sliding series of images that the user can scroll through.  Basic animation of moving through the list too. Inspired by Memory Lapse by clyde pashley https://appsto.re/au/ynhbQ.i
* __BlurRenderer__ - Xamarin.Forms iOS Native View Renderer to illustrate providing ios8 blur effect on an image all through Xamarin.Forms
